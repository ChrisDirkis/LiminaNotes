Welcome to Limina Notes!

Run by running `ts-node backend/app.ts`

Note: This is a small personal project, for learning about how to build websites with vanilla html/css/js. I've come from a React/TS background, and I'm missing a lot of the middle parts of why certain strange things are how they are.  This project should hopefully surface some of these pain points.
